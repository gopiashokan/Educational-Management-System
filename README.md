# Educational Management System (EMS)

**Introduction**

Welcome to the Educational Management System (EMS) repository! Our project aims to revolutionize how educational institutions manage administrative and academic processes, focusing on automation, communication, and real-time insights to enhance the educational experience. In today's dynamic landscape, institutions face challenges in managing tasks like student admission, course management, and exam scheduling. Our EMS offers a centralized platform that automates key tasks, facilitates seamless communication, and provides valuable insights for data-driven decision-making. Join us in shaping the future of educational management by exploring the repository and contributing to its development.

**Features**

**User Management:**
   - **Add New Users:** Admins can easily add new users to the system, facilitating the onboarding process for teachers, assistants, supersubs, and students.
   - **Update User Roles:** Admins have the authority to update user roles, ensuring appropriate access levels and permissions for different stakeholders.
   - **Password Management:** Admins can reset passwords for users who have forgotten their login credentials, ensuring seamless access to the system.
   - **User Deletion and Inactivation:** Admins can delete user accounts or temporarily deactivate them for a specified duration, maintaining the integrity and security of the user database.


**Deep Learning Model Management:**
   - **Model Training and Retraining:** Teachers can train or retrain CNN deep learning models with student handwriting data and save the models for handwriting verification.
   - **Handwriting Verification:** Teachers can utilize the trained CNN models to verify student handwriting on assessments and exam answer sheets, ensuring authenticity and accuracy.


**Test Management:**
   - **Test Creation and Deployment:** Teachers can upload Test QA (question-answer) sets to conduct tests for students, enabling seamless administration of assessments.
   - **Supersub Identification:** Teachers can identify supersubs (top-performing students) based on their scores in particular concepts, facilitating recognition and acknowledgment.


**Role and Marks Management:**
   - **Role Updates:** Teachers can update roles of students to supersubs and assistants as needed, ensuring smooth transitions and role assignments within the system.
   - **Viewing Student Marks:** Teachers have access to view student marks in both tests and exams, enabling them to monitor student progress and performance effectively.


**Test and Exam Participation:**
   - **Test Attendance and Submission:** Students can attend tests in their portal and submit their answers, facilitating remote participation and assessment.
   - **Physical Exam Submission:** Students can write assessments and exams on physical paper and submit them for evaluation, providing flexibility in assessment methods.
   - **Access to Marks:** Students can view their test and exam marks in their portal, enabling them to track their academic progress and performance over time.


**Exam Answer Sheet Management and Evaluation Process:**
   - **Collection and Upload:** Assistants and supersubs can collect student exam answer sheets and scan/upload them to the portal for evaluation and grading.
   - **Answer Sheet Evaluation:** Assistants and supersubs evaluate exam answer sheets and provide marks, ensuring fair and accurate assessment of student performance.
   - **Multiple Evaluator System:** To avoid bias, single exam answer sheets are evaluated by multiple evaluators, enhancing the reliability and validity of assessment outcomes.
